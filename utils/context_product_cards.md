## Syngenta Biological Products:
There are three key Syngenta Biological products: The Stress Buster, The Yield Booster, and The Nutrient Booster
### 1. The Stress Buster

#### Purpose:
A biostimulant designed to help plants tolerate and recover from abiotic stress conditions like drought, cold, heat, flooding, and simulated hail.

#### Science Behind:
Phenomics:
Contains selected vegetal extracts promoting synergistic action of various active ingredients.
Activates over 100 genes linked to stress response/tolerance, plant metabolism, and growth optimization.
Applied in normal conditions to enhance growth and stress tolerance.
Under drought conditions, pre-treated plants show reduced stress perception.

Transcriptomics & Metabolomics:
Modulates metabolites linked to stress response, promoting better adaptation under stressful conditions.
Shows benefits under normal and stress conditions in aspects like biomass, health index, water content, and chlorophyll indices.

#### Application:
Foliar application for row crops, vegetables, and fruit crops.
Doses range between 2-3 l/ha depending on crop type and application period.

#### Performance:
Average yield increases across trials:
    Row Crops: +0.30 t/ha (ROI: 3.9:1)
    Vegetables: +2.3 t/ha (ROI: 11.6:1)
    Fruit Crops: +1.2 t/ha (ROI: 10.5:1)
Abiotic stress conditions showing effectiveness against drought, heat, and cold.

### 2. The Yield Booster

#### Purpose:
A biostimulant aimed at enhancing productivity and maximizing returns for farmers, especially for row crops like wheat, soybean, corn, and rice.

#### Science Behind:
Phenomics:
Improves transport of sugars, nutrients, and promotes cell division.
Supports fatty acid biosynthesis and transport, enhancing photosynthesis efficiency.

Transcriptomics:
Activates genes related to nutrient transport (Zn, Fe), nitrogen assimilation, and phosphate homeostasis.
Balances hormonal processes for improved growth (auxin/cytokinin balance).

#### Application:
Foliar application targeting specific growth stages of crops (booting, heading, leaf stage, etc.).
Dosage ranges between 1-2 l/ha depending on crop type and growth stage.

#### Performance:
Crop-specific yield increases and ROI:
    Wheat: +0.30 t/ha (ROI: 3:1)
    Rice: +0.66 t/ha (ROI: 14:1)
    Soybean: +0.27 t/ha (ROI: 9:1)
    Corn: +0.64 t/ha (ROI: 7:1)
Positive yield response in 83% of corn trials, with an average increase of 6.8 Bu/A.

### 3. The Nutrient Booster (NUE Products)

#### Purpose:
Biological products designed to improve nutrient use efficiency (NUE), particularly for nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability, uptake, and overall plant health.

#### Science Behind:
Uses a combination of three endophytic bacteria strains (Sphingobium salicis, Pseudomonas siliginis, Curtobacterium salicis) to improve NUE.
Enhances phosphate solubilization and mineral nutrient uptake (Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo).
Provides plant-available nitrogen from various sources (air, soil, organic matter).

#### Application:
Seed Treatment & Foliar Application for crops like wheat, barley, corn, OSR, sugarbeet, and rice.
Dosage ranges from 10-1050 g/ha or g/T seeds, depending on crop type and formulation.

#### Performance:
Trials with corn (US, EU, 2023) under a 40-unit N reduction scenario showed:
    68% win rate (positive response)
    Average yield increase: 2.6%
    Average yield increase: 250 kg/ha
